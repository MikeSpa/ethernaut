# Solution to the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) challenges

Simple writeup of the different level of the Ethernaut wargame.

For each level, there is a small writeup to understand the vulnerabilities and how to exploit them, plus supplemental information about how solidity works. 
Each level also has a brownie script to test the hack locally and on the real level instance on the rinkeby testnet. 
When necessary, attack contract are also provided. I tried to use solidity contract to attack as much as possible instead of relying on Web3 command.
